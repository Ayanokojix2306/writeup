As I sit here thinking about everything we’ve been through, all I can feel is love—a love so deep that words cannot express. From the moment you came into my life, it feels like I’ve known you forever, like we’ve been connected in a way that transcends time and distance. We're practically INTERDESTINED. All I'm saying is that You mean everything to me.

I love you for who you are, for your kindness, your strength, and your heart that shines so bright. Every day, I find more reasons to cherish you. I love the way you make me smile, the way you challenge me to be better, and the way we support each other even when things get tough.

The past month has been a journey—one that hasn’t always been easy. We’ve faced our fair share of struggles, misunderstandings, and challenges. There were moments when things felt uncertain, but each time, we found our way back to each other. We worked through the problems, not because it was easy, but because our bond is strong enough to handle whatever comes our way. And I wouldn’t trade any of it because those challenges have only made us stronger.

I can already see how much we’ve grown and how we’ve learned to understand each other better, how we’re figuring out how to support and uplift one another. For that, I’m grateful. I’m grateful for every laugh, every tough conversation, every lesson learned. Each moment has brought us closer, and I know this is only the beginning.

Sophia, I want nothing more than for us to be together forever, to build a future that’s filled with love, joy, and endless possibilities. I imagine us facing whatever life throws at us, side by side, never giving up on each other, always choosing to love one another. I believe in us, and I believe in our future.

You have my heart, and you always will. I want to keep growing with you, keep loving you more each day, and keep building a beautiful life together. You make me happy in ways I can’t even describe, and I hope that I make you just as happy.

I love you more than I can say. Forever and always, I’m yours. Happy one month anniversary my love. May we get more anniversaries in Jesus name.</p>
